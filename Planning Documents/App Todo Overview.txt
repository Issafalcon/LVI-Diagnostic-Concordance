Tasks
----------------

1. Add globalization and localization to the app
	a. Read the docs to familiarize
	b. Create necessary resource files
	c. Add globalization stuff to existing template code where required to start
	
2. Implement Identity with login / logout / admin users / regular users / forgot password / user management etc
	a. Scaffold identity into razor pages
	b. Create custom User model with additional details
	c. Add an IEmailSender implementation with third party library

3. Design DB structure
	a. Add models for identity 
	b. Add domain models
	c. Set up entity framework with appropriate joins etc.
	
4. Move Login / Register Pages to Index / Home
	a. If user is logged in (same session) then take to welcome page with link to continue to cases
		This will continue the last case the user was looking at
		
5. Case Page
	- On load of each case page, will load a collection of ReportStatistics so we can quickly populate a set of chart series items (theoretical)
	- Will load the values for the Case number (read only for Age and Tumour Size)
	- Input values for Grade and LVI number
	- If the user is not a control group, add the JS to provide chart and probability displays
	- Otherwise just save the values entered
	- When clicking onto another case, save down the values entered, but don't mark it as 'IsSubmitted' (will need to add js to fire some arbitrary 'SaveTempData' function to the DB)
	- On submission of values, calculate all the stats for the case and add it to the DB. Check the 'IsSubmitted' flag on the user case to ensure user can't submit again
